# Kraken Frontend Test



Thanks for taking the time to check out this project, and for the opportunity to work on a flexible and well-scoped assignment.

This README includes a quick overview of what Iâ€™ve built, the thinking behind my decisions, and a few notes that might help save time while reviewing the code. I hope it gives you a clear sense of how I approach frontend development in practice.

## Development Approach

### **Framework Choice: Vite + React**
Migrated from the original Next.js setup to Vite for faster development experience and simpler configuration since SSR wasn't needed.

### **UI Framework: Material-UI**
Initially started building a custom UI component library with styled-components, but it quickly grew out of scope and was taking too much development time. Switched to MUI for faster development velocity while maintaining high-quality components. MUI provided consistent design patterns, built-in accessibility, responsive utilities, and a comprehensive theming system that allowed focusing on other things rather than rebuilding basic UI components from scratch.

### **State Management: React Context**
Used Context API for cart management - built-in, lightweight, type-safe. For an enterprise-grade app, I'd go with something more robust like Redux Toolkit.

### **Testing Strategy**
Added more testing in addition to the original 2 required tests and also set up a reusable testing foundation to make writing and maintaining tests easier and more consistent across the project. I focused on covering component behavior, integration workflows and user interactions but there's definitely more testing that could be done with additional time.

### **GraphQL with Apollo Client**
I used Apollo Client to manage all GraphQL data fetching throughout the app. It allowed me to define clean, modular queries using fragments, and handled caching and error states out of the box.

### **Responsive Design**
- Flexible grid layout for both Product List and Product Details page
- Dynamic font sizes and spacing configured based on viewport size

### **Testing Philosophy**
- User-centric testing focusing on actual user workflows
- Reusable test utilities and mock data
- Both unit tests for components and integration tests for features

## What I Would Add With More Time

- End-to-end testing with Playwright
- Cart persistence with localStorage or backend sync
- Product search, pagination and filtering (would require backend support)
- Performance monitoring and analytics
- Add skeleton loaders to improve UX during loading states
